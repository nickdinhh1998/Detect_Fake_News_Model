# Detect_Fake_News_Model
So, based on the data set news.csv, I built a model to check if the news is fake or not. To build this, I used train_test_split; TfidfVectorizer; PassiveAggressiveClassifier from sklearn, numpy and pandas library as well. It took me a week to run this successfully, thanks to some codes and lessons from Internet. However, the data set news.csv contains NaN value, which makes my build error at the end of the code. If you could suggest any solution to this, please advise. Thanks

The data set news.csv you could find here
